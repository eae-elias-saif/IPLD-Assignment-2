    "- Use at least 75% (10 out of 13) of the topics covered in the course (find them listed below). Explain briefly how each topic has been used in your solution.\n",
    "- The product must contain 3 main features that make sense in the proposed context.\n",
    "- You should follow similar coding standards and practices as those explained during the course, don't use any external libraries a part from your own ones and the Python Standard Library.\n",
    "- The interface should be developed using the console and the user input from it. You can find a developed example in the following cells (use it as a reference, adapt it to your needs and be original).\n",

    "#### Problem Description:\n",
    "In order to operate a drone company, you need to keep track of your fleet of drones not only for efficiency and good practices but also due to regulatory requirements. We need to know each drone details, flight time and maintenance schedules. Manually managing this information can be error-prone and inefficient.\n",

    "#### Solution Overview:\n",
    "We will develop a console-based Drone Fleet Management System that allows users to add drones, update their status, and view the fleet's overall status."
